# firestore-repository

A Java Repository for use with Cloud Firestore.

The aim is to create an easy-to-use Repository for using Cloud Firestore in
Android projects.  Server-side code is the target, though it may be usable from
Android clients as well. Explore at your own risk :-).

This isn't yet working, there are not even any tests, just tentative ideas
written as code.  Will update as progress is made.
